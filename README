Installation
------------

This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree for
gr-dab.

This package requires that GNU Radio is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.

It also depends on fdk-aac. If you're on a Debianoid (Debian, Mint, *buntu…),
you might want to `apt-get install fdk-aac-dev`.  If you're on a Redhatoid
(Redhat, Fedora, Centos…), `dnf install fdk-aac-devel` is the analogous method
of installing this dependency.

There is a dependency on the modified MPEG encoder libtoolame from the ODR
project. It's fetched by ´git submodule update --init´ automatically.

To build this module, run these commands:

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
