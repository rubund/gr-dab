This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree for
gr-dab.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.

To build the examples from the tarball use the normal recipe:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ sudo make install

If you're building from git, you'll need to use this sequence, since
git doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ sudo make install

Additional notes
----------------

To build gr-dab, please take into account:

* gr-dab does not work with GNU Radio 3.3; I usually work with the master
  branch from the GNU Radio git repository

* the patch in patches/not_applied_in_trunk/gr_peak_detector_XX.cc.t.diff must
  be applied to the GNU Radio trunk before building

* for the simulations in python/channel_tests/, you need the following
  additional dependencies:
   * the patches in the patches directory (except for the patches in
     'applied_in_trunk') must be applied to the GNU Radio trunk
   * Scipy (available from http://scipy.sourceforge.net)
   * Matplotlib (available from http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net)
