Google Summer of Code 2017
------------

This repository is the result of the 2017 Google Summer of Code project "A DAB/DAB+ transceiver app" by Moritz Luca Schmid. It is a fork of the [gr-dab](https://github.com/andrmuel/gr-dab) repository of Andreas Mueller which already contains the implementation of the DAB physical layer including OFDM. The following expanding work on gr-dab was done during GSoC 2017 by Moritz Luca Schmid:

* FIC source and expand FIC sink (GNU Radio blocks)
* FIC encoder, including CRC, energy dispersal, convolutional encoding with puncturing (GNU Radio blocks)
* MSC encoder and decoder, including CRC, energy dispersal/descramble, convolutional encoding/decoding with puncturing, time interleaving/deinterleaving (GNU Radio blocks)
* DAB transmission frame multiplexer (GNU Radio blocks)
* MPEG Audio Layer II encoder/decoder for DAB tranmitter/receiver (GNU Radio blocks)
* HE-AAC v2 (mp4) encoder/decoder for DAB+ transmitter/receiver (GNU Radio blocks)
* Graphical user interface for DAB/DAB+ transmission/reception (pyQt4)
* "DABstep" as an executable application for DAB/DAB+ transmission/reception

For more detailed information about the done work, containing changes in code and new code, check out the [commit history](https://github.com/kit-cel/gr-dab/commits/master) of this repository. Weekly reports containing updates about the working progress, additional information, highlights and challenging pieces during GSoC can be found on my [GSoC blog](https://dabtransceiver.wordpress.com/).


Installation
------------

This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree for
gr-dab.

This package requires that GNU Radio is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.

A dependency is the FAAD2 library. (ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libfaad-dev, fedora: sudo dnf install faad2-devel)

It also depends on fdk-aac with DAB patches (fdk-aac-dab). You'll find it in
the eponymous subdirectory; build it using:

    $ cd fdk-aac-dab
    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure [--prefix ...] [--other options]
    $ make
    $ make install

There is a dependency on the modified MPEG encoder libtoolame from the ODR
project. It's fetched by ´git submodule update --init´ automatically.

To build this module, run these commands:

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
