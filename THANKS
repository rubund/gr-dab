Code from the following two people was very helpful as a reference:

Jens Elsner - implementation of the DAB physical layer in GNU Radio
Nicolas Alt - complete DAB receiver implementation in Matlab
Jan van Katwijk - Qt-DAB: software for DAB/DAB+ reception
Matthias Braendli - ODRAudioEnc: software for encoding DAB/DAB+ audio frames
