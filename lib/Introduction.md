The GNU Radio Out-Of-Tree module gr-dab contains the necessary signal processing blocks to build a DAB/DAB+ transceiver that is capable of the transmission and reception of audio and data according to the DAB/DAB+ standard ETSI EN 300 401 V2.1.1. Hierarchical python blocks connect the blocks to a working transmitter and receiver.
